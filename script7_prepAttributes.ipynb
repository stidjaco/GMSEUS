    "* **Regarding GMSEUS_Arrays_InstYr.shp issue**: This is partially discussed in `script5` as well. \n",
    "* **Regarding CWSD Arrays**: In `script1`, we neglected to remove repeat CWSD array shapes. That means we have to do that here (for initial arrays, landtrendr outputs, and initial panel-row outputs from NAIP), which is why there is temporary code for_Remove Duplicate CWSD Arrays and Panel-Rows_ in this script, which needs to be removed on operation of v2.0.\n",
    "* **Regarding panel-rows that overlap multiple arrays**: The initial panel-row dataset (GMSEUS_Panels_ExistingAndNAIP.shp) contains 460 duplicate panelID's. Additionally, when we copy arrayID's via spatial join (twice, once in _Assign Final Panel-Row Attributes to Panel-Rows** and again in _For arrays with duplicated infomration, group and distribute attributes to arrays and panels accordingly_), panel-rows that overlap multiple arrays end up being duplicated. Currently, we maintain these for the purpose of attribution of variables to arrays, but then remove them in the final panel-row output so that panel-row dataset contains only unique panel rows (counting panel-row area only once). **If this information is desired, panel-rows can either be re-spatially joined with arrays (easiest path) thus creating duplicates, or use one of the intermediateProduct files."

If we have broken an array into two subarray chunks and in some cases two distinct arrays (and arrayID's), we cannot assign a singlular larger shapes capacity value to both shapes (2.4 MW array --> 2.4 MW + 2.4 MW arrays). Thus, in cases where checkID is repeated (match_unique_dup), we distribute reported capacity by _totArea_. This does not matter for other attributes (modType, mount, azimuth, tilt). "
