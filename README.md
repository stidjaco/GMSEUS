# A distributed ground-mounted solar energy dataset with sub-array design metadata in the United States
Repository for creating and maintaining the Ground-Mounted Solar Energy in the United States (GM-SEUS) spatiotemporal dataset of solar arrays and panel-rows using existing datasets, machine learning, and object-based image analysis to enhance existing sources. A paper in is preparation for this dataset. 

## Current Version Notes
This is the initial release of GM-SEUS (version 1.0). All input datasets and solar panel-row delineation results are up-to-date through December 11th, 2024. 

# Product Description

## Overview

Solar energy generating systems are a critical component of net-zero infrastructure, yet comprehensive datasets characterizing systems remain incomplete or not publicly available, particularly at the sub-array level. Leveraging the best freely available existing solar datasets in the US with object-based image analysis and machine learning, we present the Ground-Mounted Solar Energy in the United States (GM-SEUS) dataset, a harmonized, open access, and regularly updated geospatial and temporal repository of solar energy arrays and panel-rows. GM-SEUS v1.0 includes nearly 15,000 commercial- and utility-scale ground-mounted solar photovoltaic and concentrating solar energy arrays (## GW) covering nearly 2,900 km<sup>2</sup> and includes 2.92 million unique solar panel-rows. We use newly compiled and delineated solar panel-rows to fill gaps in, and contribute several value-added attributes to existing databases and enhance consistency across spatiotemporal attributes. Value-added attributes include installation year, azimuth, mount technology, panel-row area and dimensions, inter-row spacing, ground cover ratio, tilt, and installed capacity. By estimating and harmonizing these spatial and temporal attributes of the distributed US solar energy landscape, GM-SEUS supports diverse applications in renewable energy modeling, ecosystem service assessment, and infrastructural planning.

* **numRow**: number of panel-rows within an array, m2
* **instYr**: installation year from existing sources, with gaps filled in by instYrLT, year

# Considerations for updates in Version 2

* Add tilt to preprocessing steps in `script1` then update Check Tilt in `script7`
* Consider dropping CWSD on spatial priority list, often qualitatively under-represents array bounds. 
* Consider installation year accuracy from TZ-SAM, should it be the constructed_before date alone, or average of before and after? Currently average. 
* Consider making QA/QC criteria less strict, removal of panel groupings to generate array area first?
* Manually digitize/georectify remaining point data (1,490 points)
* Consider following methods of TZ-SAM for version updates: Compile into *raw_polygons* and consider spatial quality that way. 
* TZ-SAM also contains *raw_polygons*, which are all overlapping polygon shapefiles from all sources (including prior TZ-SAM versions). Could be useful in the future, or even a pathway that we use to share data. 
* Solve overlap issue due to USPVDB array boundary "cut" from V1 to V2
    * Choose if new array delineation in script5 should be independent or dependent on existing array boundaries (group by arrayID or only by proximity then explode?). Currently group by arrayID.
    * Would result in array boundaries that may overlap multiple original array shapes (maybe only a problem for cut USPVDB boundaries)
